## What is this ?
This projet is a simple implementation of neural networks in C++.
It is meant to be a learning project, so it is not optimized for performance or memory usage.
It has been written almost entirely from scratch, with the exception of some libraries for file handling, random number generation, and other classical C++ libraries.

## Usage
Everything you need is in main.cpp.
You can customoze the parameters of the neural network in the main function.
A future improvement would be to be able to configure the neural network from the command line or a configuration file.
